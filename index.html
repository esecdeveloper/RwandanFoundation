RWANDAN CHILDREN 

Sonia Gisa’s Rwandan Children foundation :

Health - Hope - Happiness 

A foundation for the next generation in Rwanda; providing support for education, healthcare, and other basic necessities.


Growing up in Rwanda right after the genocide, I was supported by many Non-Governmental Organisations. Without these organisations, all of my childhood needs would have been difficult to cover. The NGOs provided school fees and food. One organisation also managed to bring water to my home village. However, as Africa is no longer in a time of post-war, there are not many NGOs providing support. Even if they were present, they could never cover the needs of all children.
Growing up, I felt that I had a purpose to go back and provide the same support that I received when I was young. We started by donating clothes to children and look forward to providing school fees.

If you also have a heart for helping less fortunate children to provide a better life and future, join us.
How many SMILES would you like to give out today ?
Every dollar gives a smile 😀

            <h3><strong>Sonia Gisa</strong></h3>
            <br/>
            <p>In 2009, aged 18, Sonia Gisa moved to Belgium from her native Rwanda, where as a child she had lived through the genocide that saw her father killed. She spoke French, soon found her way into an educational programme and within a year had embarked on what would develop into an award-winning modelling career. But, as she details in an extract from her memoir, Slaughter Baby, the culture shock was slightly more than she bargained for.</p>
            
            <p>Growing up in Rwanda right after the genocide, I was supported by many Non-Governmental Organisations. Without these organisations, all of my childhood needs would have been difficult to cover. The NGOs provided school fees and food. One organisation also managed to bring water to my home village. However, as Rwanda is no longer in a time of post-war, there are not many NGOs providing support. Even if they were present, they could never cover the needs of all children.
            <br/><br/>
Growing up, I felt that I had a purpose to go back and provide the same support that I received when I was young. We started by donating clothes to children and look forward to providing school fees.

            <br/>
            <p>In 2016, along with other former pageant title holders, Sonia Gisa joined Mission Onlus NGO.<br/><br/>

Mission Onlus was founded by Valeria Altobelli in order to raise funds for female and child victims of domestic violence in Italy. Events for Mission Onlus have taken place in Italy every year since. In the first year, 35,000 euros was raised by the NGO. Mission Onlus’ slogan is ‘Inner beauty can save the world’.</p>
